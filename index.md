## Motivation

I have been working as a UX-Developer at ACL Services using React for almost 3 years now, during this journey I had experiences different perception of what it is React and how one should build interfaces using it.

Experiences, ideas and phylosopies were from using only controlled components and nothing more to not use react state and let redux controls the entire application state. 

During these time I have ideate an architecture for the apps/features that I build, which based it's design in a series of layers that specialized in dealing with specific concerns of the App that is been build, Allowing the developer to reason only about one specific concept at the time.

## Goal

My goal for sharing this is to help other new comers and current react developers to understand how to apply better the different patterns that exist on the react ecosystem.

To help me to explain better these concepts, I will use only react and nothing else, keep in mind that these concept can easily be extrapolated for tools like Redux or any other state manager. 

Also I would like to add that some of the concept that I will use in my examples are inspired by Redux.
